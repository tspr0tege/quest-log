# Quest Log Readme

The vision behind this project is a desire to apply what I know about productivity, goal setting, and time management to an app made for gamers, by a gamer by combining all of that with game theory concepts to help make real life achievement just a little more engaging and familiar.

Basically, I wish to help my fellow gamers win at life the way they win at the games they love, and build an IRL legacy.

And yes, help myself in the same way.

## The ultimate vision

If the app I have in my head, matched the one deployed, it would be significantly more robust. The short version is that I want the app to be an instrument of immense focus, ease of use in tracking goals and habits, and to have a detailed history for someone to go back through and see all they've accomplished. In rough order, the things I'd like to add are:

1) a habit/routine tracking system that allows users to keep track of things like savings goals, daily step count, number of sales calls, and the like
2) timed and recurring tasks that propagate on the dashboard when appropriate
3) much more detailed profiles that track things like values, motivations, skills, and lots more, which tasks, habits, and routines can be mapped to for exp growth
4) a daily guided planning session to help pare down concerns and focus on what's highest priority and most reasonable to finish that day/week/month/year
5) an education platform for both self-mastery/discovery and improving productivity; I've also thought about this as one possible avenue for monetization
6) a blog system and calendar, so someone can go back through their history and sees thoughts, wins, progress, etc. I want this to offer both: useful insights, and inspiration.
7) integration with one or several online retail platforms, for users to implement automatic rewards for themselves when they achieve major goals. ie: once a certain weight-loss goal is achieved, the system can order/ship a specific outfit that was pre-chosen and paid for

This is the relatively simple version, and yes, I'm almost certainly in over my exceptionally large head. One must dream.

### As of 08-19-2024

In its current state, Quest Log is deployed and useable, but does little more than act as a to-do list with a small exp reward on your profile, for completing tasks.

Most of the work done up to this point has been trying to make the code clean and modular, and make future iterations more natural.

There has also been some considerable work done to the design itself, but I must admit this is my singular weakest ability when it comes to web development and I am seriously considering hiring someone to help with a proper UI design.

It's possible to use on desktop or mobile right now, but due to browser bars, some controls may get cut-off on the mobile display. To accomodate for this, I've added a fullscreen button to the mobile menu.

This is the first time I've put anything of any substance in the README since starting this project. Going forward, I'll maintain a periodic log like this for updates, as they happen, but I'm not sure when I will work on this project next as working in Godot has captured vast majority of my programming attention, of late.
